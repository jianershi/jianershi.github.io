This post is a response to Stackoverflow question [How to connect backend service with philips hue bridge remotely?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19900657/how-to-connect-backend-service-with-philips-hue-bridge-remotely) I realized later that I don't have enough reputation to post so many links. So it is explained here.

The question actually comes as two part:

* Authentication
* Remote Control

##Authentication

I haven't figure out a reliable way to do authentication automatically. The following procedures needs to be automated: The idea is to fake as official iOS APP which has the ability to control remotely when enabled. We will need to get `BRIDGEID` and `ACCESSTOKEN` to pass the authentication step for remote control.

1. Find your `BRIDGEID` from [https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp](https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp). (or in [My bridge](https://www.meethue.com/en-US/user/preferencessmartbridge) page on the meethue website and by clicking on "Show me more")

2. Get `ACCESSTOKEN`

		www.meethue.com/en-US/api/gettoken?devicename=iPhone+5&appid=hueapp&deviceid=**BRIDGEID**

3. **Right** click on "BACK TO THE APP" and write down `ACCESSTOKEN` inside the link it redirect to

		phhueapp://sdk/login/**ACCESSTOKEN**

Basically it is a hack to get your access token. You fake your app as the official iOS Hue App, and ask for access token that way. I am not sure there is an easier way out there, if you do know one, please do comment below. 

You can potentially automate it by doing simulated log-in session and grab the the `ACCESSTOKEN` by scraping the page content. But I consider it highly unreliable because any change to the official page will likely break it. 

I wrote this [script](https://github.com/jarvisinc/PhilipsHueRemoteAPI/blob/master/getToken.py) that allows the automation of getting `ACCESSTOKEN` as of today, but I don't guarantee it will work tomorrow for the reason I explained above :P

Currently, this OAUTH process only works with official apps. There might be a slight chance that they will open it to other 3rd party apps.

##Remote Control

Once authentication is done, this part can be done automatically. There are 2 known private endpoints for sending control command and getting all the status related to the hue bridge. 

* Sending Command Endpoint:

		POST https://www.meethue.com/api/sendmessage

* Getting Status Endpoint:

		GET https://www.meethue.com/api/getbridge

###Sending Command Endpoint

* URL: `https://www.meethue.com/api/sendmessage`

* Method: `POST`

* URL Parameters: 
	
		token=**ACCESSTOKEN** (which you obtained earlier)

* Request header
		
		content-type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		
* body

		clipmessage={ bridgeId: "**BRIDGEID**", clipCommand: { url: "/api/0/**APIENDPOINT**", method: "**METHOD**", body: **JSONCOMMAND** } }

	* `BRIDGEID` is the same one you obtained earlier
	* `APIENDPOINT` the same as official API `/api/<username>/***` by removing `/api/<usename>/` part
	* `METHOD` PUT/GET/POST/DELETE the same 4 method as official API. Despite GET really doesn't work since all response from the Sending Command Endpoint is 200 explained in the following part, while DELETE is not tested
	* `JSONCOMMAND` The actual command body for example `{"on":true}`


###Getting Status Endpoint

* URL: `https://www.meethue.com/api/getbridge`

* Method: `GET`
	
* URL Parameters: 
	
		token=**ACCESSTOKEN**
		bridgeid=**BRIDGEID**

* Request header
		
		content-type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded



###Limitations

Current limitation is you cannot immediately know from the response whether your control command succeeded like the official API. All the response you get from calling the Sending Command Endpoint is pretty much always `<200>` if you are doing it correctly. But you can always pull all the status related to the Hue bridge from the Getting Status Endpoint.


###Remote Control API

I wrote [Philips HUE Remote API](https://github.com/jarvisinc/PhilipsHueRemoteAPI) to specifically solve the remote control problem.

Enjoy :)
